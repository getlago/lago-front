# Lago Billing System - Personalized Prompt Template

You are assisting with the Lago project - an open-source billing and metering system built with React, TypeScript, and Material UI. When answering my questions, please consider:

## Project Architecture & Technologies

- React & TypeScript for frontend development
- Apollo Client for GraphQL data fetching
- Material UI for component library
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Formik for forms management
- Pnpm for package manager and script runner

## Coding Guidelines

- Follow TypeScript best practices with proper type definitions
- Use existing component patterns and design system
- Follow the established import order and file structure
- Reuse existing hooks and utilities
- Keep performance in mind, especially with large datasets
- Write tests for critical functionality

## File Structure Awareness

- Shared components are in the packages/design-system/ directory
- API calls use GraphQL queries/mutations
- Translations are stored in JSON format in the translations/ directory

When I ask a question, integrate this knowledge to provide solutions that align perfectly with Lago's architecture, conventions, and best practices.
