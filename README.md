# Lago

Lago is an open-source Stripe Billing alternative.

This library will allow you to build an entire billing logic from scratch, even the most complex one. Lago is a real-time event-based library made for usage-based billing, subscription-based billing, and all the nuances of pricing in between.

## AI-Assisted Development Skills

This project includes a set of custom skills for AI coding assistants (Claude Code and Cursor) that automate common migration and testing workflows. Skills are invoked via slash commands.

| Skill                          | Command                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Make Tests**                 | `/make-tests <pr-number \| branch>`  | Detects modified component files from a PR or branch, adds `data-test` attributes, and creates or migrates tests following project testing conventions.                                                    |
| **Migrate Dialog**             | `/migrate-dialog <path>`             | Migrates a dialog component from the legacy imperative ref-based `Dialog` system (`forwardRef` + `useImperativeHandle`) to the new hook-based NiceModal system (`useFormDialog` / `useCentralizedDialog`). |
| **Migrate Formik to TanStack** | `/migrate-formik-to-tanstack <path>` | Migrates a React form from Formik (`useFormik` + Yup) to TanStack Form (`useAppForm` + Zod), following project conventions.                                                                                |

## Running Multiple Frontends in Parallel

The `lago-worktree` script lets you run isolated frontend instances side-by-side using git worktrees. Each worktree gets its own branch, Docker container, and port — only the **front** (and optionally the **API**) run in a separate container, while everything else (database, Redis, Redpanda, PDF service, etc.) is shared with the main stack.

This is especially useful for **AI-assisted development**: you can spin up parallel worktrees and let multiple AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) work on different tickets simultaneously, each in its own isolated environment other then the main branch.

### Setup

Add an alias to your shell config (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, etc.):

```bash
export LAGO_PATH=/Users/<PATH_TO>/lago
alias lago-worktree="$LAGO_PATH/front/scripts/lago-worktree.sh"
```

Then reload your shell (`source ~/.zshrc`) or open a new terminal.

### Prerequisites

- The main Lago stack must be running (`lago up -d`)
- Docker and `pnpm` installed

### Quick Start

```bash
# Create a worktree and start it (front only, shares the main API)
lago-worktree create LAGO-0001

# Create a worktree with a dedicated API container too
lago-worktree create LAGO-0001 --from-api=main

# Branch off a specific front branch instead of main
lago-worktree create LAGO-0001 --from-front=feat/ui

# Both custom bases
lago-worktree create LAGO-0001 --from-front=feat/ui --from-api=feat/endpoint
```

### Commands

| Command                                                     | Description                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `create <branch> [--from-front=<base>] [--from-api=<base>]` | Create worktree(s) and start containers              |
| `up <name>`                                                 | Start an existing (stopped) worktree                 |
| `down <name>`                                               | Stop containers and free the port                    |
| `destroy <name>`                                            | Stop containers **and delete** the worktree + branch |
| `ps`                                                        | List all worktree instances with status and ports    |

### How It Works

- **Front ports** are auto-assigned and auto-incremented starting from `3001` (`3001`, `3002`, `3003`, ...).
- **API ports** (when using `--from-api`) are auto-assigned and auto-incremented starting from `4001` (`4001`, `4002`, `4003`, ...).
- Each worktree container joins the shared `lago_dev_default` Docker network, so it can reach the database, Redis, and other services from the main stack.
- Without `--from-api`, the front proxies API calls to the shared main API on port `3000`.

### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start working on a ticket
lago-worktree create LAGO-1234

# 2. Open http://localhost:3001 in the browser

# 3. Check running instances
lago-worktree ps

# 4. Stop when done for the day
lago-worktree down LAGO-1234

# 5. Resume later
lago-worktree up LAGO-1234

# 6. No longer needed or merged into main — clean up everything
lago-worktree destroy LAGO-1234
```
