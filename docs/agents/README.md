# Agents Documentation

This folder contains the AI agents documentation divided by topic.

## Structure

Files are organized in numerical order to maintain the inclusion order:

**Note**: The introduction is included directly in the main `AGENTS.md` file and is not stored as a separate file.

- `01-package-manager.md` - Package management and workspace
- `02-project-stack.md` - Technology stack and architecture
- `03-development-guidelines.md` - Development guidelines
- `04-file-structure.md` - File structure and conventions
- `05-scripts-commands.md` - Main scripts and commands
- `06-code-quality.md` - Code quality standards
- `07-testing-practices.md` - Testing best practices
- `08-typescript-conventions.md` - TypeScript conventions
- `09-folder-architecture.md` - Folder architecture
- `10-documentation.md` - Documentation and library references

## How to update the documentation

1. Edit the `.md` files in this folder according to the topic of interest
2. Run `pnpm run build:agents` to regenerate `AGENTS.md` in the project root
3. The `AGENTS.md` file is automatically generated by merging all files in order

## Notes

- The `AGENTS.md` file in the project root is automatically generated and **should not be edited manually**
- The introduction section is hardcoded in the build script and included directly in `AGENTS.md`
- All other changes must be made in the `.md` files in this folder
- After each modification, remember to run `pnpm run build:agents` to update `AGENTS.md`
